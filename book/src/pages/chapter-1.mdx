# Chapter 1: What is a Switch?

A **switch** is an assistive technology device that provides a simple binary input: **ON** or **OFF**. Unlike a keyboard with many keys or a mouse with X/Y coordinates, a switch is the simplest possible input mechanism.

## Why Switches Matter

For people with severe physical disabilities, a switch may be the **only reliable voluntary movement** they can perform. Scanning turns this single binary input into full access.

## Physical Switch Types

- **Button Switches** — Large or small buttons activated with any body part
- **Joystick Switches** — Directional switches activated by tilting
- **Pressure Pads** — Activated by leaning or pressing
- **Puff/Sip Switches** — Controlled by breath through a tube
- **Muscle Sensors** — Detect muscle contraction (e.g., eyebrow raise)
- **Beam Switches** — Broken by hand movement through infrared beam
