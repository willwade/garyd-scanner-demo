# Chapter 11: Efficiency Calculator

Use this chapter to compare scan costs across patterns and layouts.

## Scan Distance Matters

Every item has a **scan distance**: the number of scan steps required to reach it. Reordering items so common targets have shorter distances can dramatically improve TER.

## Practical Use

Use the calculator to compare layouts and see how many presses each pattern requires. This helps OTs choose a grid that balances speed and cognitive load.

## Frequency vs Alphabetical Layout

Placing frequent letters early can halve scan time for common words.

<div class="info-box">
  Tip: Use frequency layout for communication grids unless there is a strong reason for alphabetical order.
</div>

## Demo (Alphabetical vs Frequency)

<div class="demo-instructions">
  🎮 Compare how quickly you can select common letters in each layout.
</div>
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr)); gap: 16px;">
  <div>
    <h4>Alphabetical</h4>
    <div class="scanner-container small">
      <switch-scanner theme="sketch" scan-pattern="row-column" layout-mode="alphabetical" grid-size="26"></switch-scanner>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Frequency</h4>
    <div class="scanner-container small">
      <switch-scanner theme="sketch" scan-pattern="row-column" layout-mode="frequency" grid-size="26"></switch-scanner>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  Efficiency is not only about scan rate. Layout, prediction, and error recovery often deliver larger gains than raw speed.
</div>
