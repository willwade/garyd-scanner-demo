# Chapter 12: Patterns & Modes Hub

This is the one-stop reference for **patterns** (structure) and **modes** (behavior).

## Patterns (Structure)

- **Linear:** Item-by-item scan.
- **Row-Column:** Rows first, then items within a row.
- **Progressive Segmenting / Elimination:** Repeatedly split until target remains.

## Modes (Behavior)

- **Continuous:** Smooth, mouse-like movement.
- **Probability (PPM):** Items scan by likelihood, not position.
- **Cause-Effect:** Single-item training mode.
- **Group-Row-Column:** Explicit group stage before rows/columns.

## Probability (PPM) Demo

<div class="demo-instructions">
  🎮 Watch how the scan prioritizes likely items first.
</div>
<div class="scanner-container small">
  <switch-scanner theme="sketch" scan-mode="probability" grid-size="26"></switch-scanner>
</div>

<div class="highlight-box">
  PPM is especially useful for AAC where words and letters have strong usage frequency. Use this demo as the reference point for “predictive scanning.”
