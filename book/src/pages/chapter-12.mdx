# Chapter 12: Patterns & Modes Hub

This is the one-stop reference for **patterns** (structure) and **modes** (behavior).

## The 7 Key Components

1. **Pattern** (structure)
2. **Mode** (behavior)
3. **Technique** (block vs point)
4. **Direction** (scan order)
5. **Timing** (scan rate, delays)
6. **Visualization** (highlight style)
7. **Error Recovery** (undo, cancel, back)

## Patterns (Structure)

- **Linear:** Item-by-item scan.
- **Row-Column:** Rows first, then items within a row.
- **Progressive Segmenting / Elimination:** Repeatedly split until target remains.

## Modes (Behavior)

- **Continuous:** Smooth, mouse-like movement.
- **Probability (PPM):** Items scan by likelihood, not position.
- **Cause-Effect:** Single-item training mode.
- **Group-Row-Column:** Explicit group stage before rows/columns.
- **ColorCode:** Two-button Bayesian selection using red/blue assignments.

## Probability (PPM) Demo

<div class="demo-instructions">
  🎮 Watch how the scan prioritizes likely items first.
</div>
<div class="scanner-container small">
  <switch-scanner theme="sketch" scan-mode="probability" grid-content="keyboard" grid-size="26"></switch-scanner>
</div>

<div class="highlight-box">
  PPM is especially useful for AAC where words and letters have strong usage frequency. Use this demo as the reference point for “predictive scanning.”
</div>

## ColorCode Demo (Two Buttons)

<div class="demo-instructions">
  🎮 Press <strong>1</strong> for blue or <strong>2</strong> for red. The system reassigns colors after each click and selects once it’s confident.
</div>
<div class="scanner-container small">
  <switch-scanner
    theme="sketch"
    scan-mode="color-code"
    grid-content="keyboard"
    grid-size="26"

  This mode is inspired by ColorCode (Daly, 2022): a Bayesian two-button system that uses color assignments and a language model to infer intent. [Paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.slpat-1.2.pdf)
