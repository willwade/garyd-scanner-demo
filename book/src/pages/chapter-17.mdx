# Chapter 17: Critical Overscan

Critical overscan scans fast, then slows down on demand for precise selection.

Think of it as “fast sweep + careful return.” This is useful when users can identify a target quickly but need more time to press accurately.

## When it helps

- Very large linear lists
- Fast reaction times
- Avoiding complex grouping

## Design Notes

- Keep the fast phase short enough to avoid fatigue.
- Slow phase should be long enough to allow accurate presses (often 2–3× slower).
- Provide a clear “return” cue so users know the slow pass is active.

## Demo

<div class="demo-instructions">
  🎮 Try it: press when your target passes, then select on the slow return.
</div>
<div class="scanner-container">
  <switch-scanner
    theme="sketch"
    scan-pattern="linear"
    critical-overscan-enabled="true"
    critical-overscan-fast-rate="200"
    critical-overscan-slow-rate="1200"
    grid-size="36">
  </switch-scanner>
</div>
