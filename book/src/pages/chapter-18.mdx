# Chapter 18: Directed Scanning

Directed scanning lets users steer focus with directional switches.

It works best when users have reliable control in 2+ directions and can interpret spatial movement. It can reduce waiting time, but increases cognitive load.

## Switch configurations

- Full directional (4+ switches)
- Reduced directional (right + down with wrap)
- Rotating arrow selection

## Reduced Switch Mode

With only two switches, systems often use **right + down** and wrap at edges to reach every item. It’s slower than full directional, but still reduces waiting compared to auto-scan.

## Design Notes

- Make the current focus obvious (crosshair, halo, or block highlight).
- Use consistent wrap rules (end-of-row/column behavior).
- Provide a simple “undo” path to avoid dead ends.

## Demo

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(260px, 1fr)); gap: 16px;">
  <div>
    <h4>Compass (Fixed-8)</h4>
    <div class="scanner-container small">
      <switch-scanner theme="sketch" scan-mode="continuous" continuous-technique="eight-direction" compass-mode="fixed-8" grid-size="16"></switch-scanner>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>Compass (Fluid)</h4>
    <div class="scanner-container small">
      <switch-scanner theme="sketch" scan-mode="continuous" continuous-technique="eight-direction" compass-mode="continuous" grid-size="16"></switch-scanner>
    </div>
