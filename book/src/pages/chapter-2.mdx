# Chapter 2: The Bandwidth Problem

**Input Bandwidth** refers to the amount of information a user can transmit per unit of time.

| Input Type | Bandwidth | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Touch Typist | High (10+ fingers) | ~100 words/minute |
| Hunt & Peck | Medium (1-2 fingers) | ~20 words/minute |
| Switch User | Low (1 binary input) | ~5-15 words/minute |

## The Sushi Bar Analogy

Imagine a sushi bar where dishes rotate past you on a conveyor belt. You cannot reach everything at once—you must wait for the dish you want to come to you, then grab it quickly.

<div class="info-box">
  <strong>Switch users trade TIME for ACCESS.</strong> They don't have instant access to any item like a mouse user. They must wait for the scan to reach the item they want, then activate their switch at precisely the right moment.
</div>
