# Chapter 20: Feedback & Highlighting

Effective feedback reduces errors and builds trust. Make the active item obvious, and make selection feel intentional.

## Design Goals

- **Clarity**: the active item should be unambiguous from 1–2 meters away.
- **Consistency**: the same signal should mean the same thing everywhere.
- **Low cognitive load**: feedback should not compete with reading or comprehension.

## Visual feedback

- Clear border or color highlight
- Optional scale or pulse on the active item
- Dim non-highlighted items to reduce scan noise

Avoid ambiguous color pairs (red/green) and ensure highlights pass contrast checks on light and dark backgrounds.

## Auditory & tactile feedback

- Short beep per highlight
- Distinct selection sound
- Tactile click or vibration (if available)

Keep highlight sounds short and uniform. Selection sounds can be slightly longer to confirm action without slowing timing.

## Timing and Motion

- Animations should finish well within the scan delay.
- Keep transitions subtle to avoid “tracking” the animation instead of the item.
- Allow a “no motion” setting for users who are distracted by animation.
