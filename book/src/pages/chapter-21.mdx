# Chapter 21: User Profiles

Different users need different configurations. Treat profiles as stable baselines that can be tuned, not as fixed diagnoses.

## What a Profile Should Capture

- **Input capability**: mean switch press time, variability, and acceptance delay needs.
- **Visual preferences**: highlight size, contrast, animation speed, and symbol size.
- **Cognitive load**: grid size, scan pattern complexity, and prediction usage.
- **Fatigue**: how settings should shift over time or after prolonged use.
- **Environment**: lighting, noise, and seated vs. reclined positioning.

## Example Profiles

- **Athetosis**: longer acceptance delay, slightly slower scan, higher tolerance for missed first-row selections.
- **Degenerative conditions**: “fresh” vs. “fatigued” presets with different scan delays and prediction lists.
- **Low vision**: high contrast, thicker borders, larger highlight area, fewer items per row.
- **High cognitive load**: smaller grids, fewer modes, predictable scan order.

## Practical Tips for Teams

- Always keep a “safe” fallback profile that is slow and forgiving.
- Version profiles and log when changes are applied.
- Use short tests to validate profile changes before daily use.

  Always validate settings with real use. Lab performance rarely matches daily life.
