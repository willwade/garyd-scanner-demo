# Chapter 23: Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing for scanning is mostly about timing, visibility, and error recovery. Aim for repeatable checks.

## Core tests

- **Single-switch simulation:** Use only Space to test all paths.
- **Timing sweeps:** Test slow/medium/fast rates.
- **Error drills:** Practice undo, cancel, and recovery.
- **Fatigue runs:** 20–30 minutes sustained use.

## Measurement Checklist

- Record TER, scanning errors, and reaction time before and after changes.
- Verify that any highlight is visible in low light and bright light.
- Confirm the user can recover within two scan cycles.
- Validate at least one “safe mode” configuration.

## Common failure modes

- No undo/back path
- Highlights too subtle
- Scan loops never end
- User can’t recover from a mistake in under two cycles
