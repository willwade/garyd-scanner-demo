# Chapter 24: Design Patterns

Design patterns help keep scanning consistent while still allowing speed and flexibility.

## Patterns That Work Well

- **Progressive disclosure**: show a small set of core items first, then expand.
- **Most recently used (MRU)**: bubble frequent selections to faster positions.
- **Predictive order**: place likely next items earlier in the scan path.
- **Context-aware grids**: switch layouts based on task context (spelling vs. commands).
- **Safe defaults**: a “slow and clear” profile that users can always return to.

## When to Avoid Patterns

Avoid patterns that reorder too aggressively during a selection. Sudden movement breaks timing and increases errors.
