# Chapter 5: Single Switch Scanning

**Single Switch Scanning (Auto-Scan)** is the most common scanning method.

## How it works

1. System automatically highlights items in sequence
2. User waits for desired item to be highlighted
3. User presses switch to select
4. System activates item and restarts scan

## Timing tips

- **Too fast** → missed selections
- **Too slow** → frustration and low TER
- **Just right** → user feels in control

## Variants You’ll See in Real Devices

- **Auto-while-held:** The highlight moves only while the switch is held down.
- **Auto-restart modes:** Restart from the first item or continue from last.
- **Initial item pause:** Extra time on the first item to help users get ready.
