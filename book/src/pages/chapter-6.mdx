# Chapter 6: Two Switch Scanning

**Two Switch Scanning (Step Scan)** gives the user more control over timing.

## How it works

- **Switch 1 (Advance):** Move to next item
- **Switch 2 (Select):** Choose current item

## Comparison: Auto-Scan vs Step Scan

| Feature | Auto-Scan (1 Switch) | Step Scan (2 Switches) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Timing control | System controls | User controls |
| Cognitive load | Must watch timing | No timing pressure |
| Physical effort | 1 switch | 2 switches |
| Speed | Fixed | Variable (user-paced) |

## Step Scan Alternation (Swap Switch)

Some systems swap switch roles after each selection to balance physical load.

## Demo
