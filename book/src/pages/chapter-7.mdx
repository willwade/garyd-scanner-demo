# Chapter 7: Why Group?

Linear scanning of large sets is painfully slow. Grouping reduces scan cost dramatically.

## Grouping and Hierarchy

Large selection sets are usually organized into **layers**:

- **Items** (individual cells)
- **Groups** (rows, columns, or clusters of items)
- **Super-groups** (pages or tabs)

This hierarchy reduces scan time and cognitive load. Most systems use a two-level hierarchy, but some allow deeper nesting.

## Scan Cost

For **N** items in linear scan:

- Average cost to select any item = **N/2**
- Cost to select last item = **N**

<div class="highlight-box">
  Grouping items into rows or groups can cut scan cost by 50% or more.
</div>

## Example: 36 items (6×6)

- Linear average cost: 18 presses
- Row-column average cost: 9 presses

<div class="highlight-box">
  That’s about 50% faster. Grouping cuts the scan cost in half for medium grids.
</div>

## Quick Comparison

| Method | Max Presses | Average Presses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linear (36 items) | 36 | 18 |
| Row‑Column (6×6) | 12 | 9 |

<div class="info-box">
  Groups can be presented as pages, tabs, rows, or columns. The goal is to reduce the distance to frequently used items.
</div>
