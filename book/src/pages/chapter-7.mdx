# Chapter 7: Why Group?

Linear scanning of large sets is painfully slow. Grouping reduces scan cost dramatically.

## Scan Cost

For **N** items in linear scan:

- Average cost to select any item = **N/2**
- Cost to select last item = **N**

<div class="highlight-box">
  Grouping items into rows or groups can cut scan cost by 50% or more.
</div>

## Example: 36 items (6×6)

- Linear average cost: 18 presses
- Row-column average cost: 9 presses
