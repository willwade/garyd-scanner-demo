# Chapter 8: Row-Column Scanning

**Row-Column Scanning** is the most common grouped scanning method.

## How it works

**Stage 1:** Scan rows → select a row

**Stage 2:** Scan items in the row → select item

## Why it’s effective

Row-column scanning reduces scan cost for medium-to-large grids. A 6×6 grid takes at most 12 presses, not 36.

## Related Variants

- Column-Row scanning
- Mixed group + row/column scans

  Tip: For dense grids, try **point technique** to reduce visual clutter. For beginners, start with **block technique**.
</div>
