# Chapter 9: Progressive Segmenting & Elimination

**Progressive segmenting** repeatedly divides the set until the target remains. **Elimination scanning** is the most common form.

## Common techniques

- **Halving** (binary split)
- **Quartering** (quadrants)
- **Scan-direct** (many groups)

## Trade-offs

- **Fast once learned**, but higher cognitive load.
- Can be confusing for beginners.
- Works best for large grids (64+ items).

## Example: 64 items with 4-switch elimination

1. Select quadrant (16 items remain)
2. Select sub-quadrant (4 items remain)
3. Select item

<div class="highlight-box">
  Elimination scanning offers logarithmic efficiency: big grids become fast once learned.
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  Switch count trade-off: 2 switches means more steps, 4 or 8 switches means fewer steps if the user can reliably control them.
</div>

## Efficiency Snapshot (64 items)

| Method | Max Presses | Average Presses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linear | 64 | 32 |
| Row‑Column (8×8) | 16 | 9 |
| Elimination (4‑switch) | 3 | 3 |

<div class="info-box">
  Rule of thumb: use the maximum number of switches a user can reliably control. More switches mean fewer steps.
</div>
