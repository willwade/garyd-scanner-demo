# Chapter 9: Progressive Segmenting & Elimination

**Progressive segmenting** repeatedly divides the set until the target remains. **Elimination scanning** is the most common form.

## Common techniques

- **Halving** (binary split)
- **Quartering** (quadrants)
- **Scan-direct** (many groups)

## Example: 64 items with 4-switch elimination

1. Select quadrant (16 items remain)
2. Select sub-quadrant (4 items remain)
3. Select item

  Elimination scanning offers logarithmic efficiency: big grids become fast once learned.
